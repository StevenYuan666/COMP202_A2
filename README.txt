This is the README file for the first half of assignment2.

Initially, my is_ostring function does not work well, and I cannot debug it by myself, so I posted a question in the discussion board. Professor Giulia told me that it may be related to the way I check the newline sign ‘\n’. Then I figured out that ‘\n’ would be counted as one character in python, and fixed my function finally.

Additionally, there is something wrong with final function in english_braille module. When the python compare the two text, there're something wrong. Then I discussed and exchange the function's logic with Limerence(I don't know her legal name). Finally, I fixed all bugs.
