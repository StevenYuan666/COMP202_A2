# An English and French Braille Translator
To start, watch this video on the basics of English Braille: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqQ3gdE7ks0

In Braille, characters are represented by cells. A cell generally represents one letter. A cell contains six (or sometimes eight) positions for dots, in two columns. At each position, there could be a raised (shaded) dot, or left flat (empty).

All Braille systems are organized into decades: ordered groups of 10 letters. Each position in the decade has an associated pattern. See the YouTube video for more on the patterns and a mnemonic for memorizing them.

English Braille has two and a half decades for its letters, French has four. When Braille was devel- oped in the 19th century, the letter ‘w’ was not commonly used in French. This is why ‘w’ is not where you’d expect it in the alphabet in either system.

The 40 letters make up a table of four rows and ten columns. We will be counting from zero for the rows and columns, since Python and other programming languages work this way.

Decade 0 is also used to represent the digits 1-9 and 0, in that order. So 1 is the same as ‘a’, etc.

Finally, there is another decade to represent the most common punctuation, where we take the decade-pattern and shift it all downward. Note the most common punctuation in French Braille is different from English Braille (in the video).

Finally, there are six more important characters in French to know about which do not follow the decade pattern. Note the capital symbol in French Braille is different from the English Braille one in the video.
